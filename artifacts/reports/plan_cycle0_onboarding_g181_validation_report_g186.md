# Plan Validation Report: Onboarding Flow Implementation (plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181)

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD (To be filled)
**Plan ID:** `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181`
**Plan Status:** `COMPLETED_SUCCESS`
**Global Event Count (g) at Validation:** 186
**Originating Artifact (Overall Blueprint):** `cycle0_blueprint_proto_frame`
**Preceding Plan (if applicable):** N/A (This plan executed a specific feature set within the cycle0 blueprint)

## 1. Executive Summary

This report validates the successful completion of the "Onboarding Flow Implementation" plan (`plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181`). The plan's primary goal was to refactor the existing `OnboardingPage.tsx` and develop a modular, interactive onboarding experience for the web prototype, serving as a precursor to the mobile application. Key objectives included an initial 'Welcome' screen with logo animation, a carousel of 3-4 interactive slides, navigation via swipe and dot indicators (eliminating Next/Skip/Back buttons), and integrated 'Log In'/'Sign Up' CTAs on each slide.

All defined tasks within the plan have been marked as `DONE`. The outputs, including the refactored `OnboardingPage.tsx` and new modular components (`OnboardingLogo.tsx`, `OnboardingSlide.tsx`, `SlideVisual.tsx`, `SlideTextContent.tsx`, `SlideNavigation.tsx`), align with the plan's objectives. The `registry_map.txt` has been updated to reflect all new and modified artifacts.

## 2. Plan Goal and Scope Adherence

**Goal:** "To develop and implement the T-01b Onboarding flow as a web prototype for the target mobile-only application. This involves refactoring the existing `OnboardingPage.tsx` to include an initial 'Welcome' screen with logo animation, followed by a carousel of 3-4 interactive onboarding slides with distinct content. Slides will feature modular components (Logo, Background/Visual Area, Text Content, Navigation Controls with per-slide 'Log In' and 'Sign Up' Call-to-Actions). Navigation will be via swipe and clickable dot indicators only (no Next, Skip, or Back buttons). The implementation will use React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Framer Motion, adhering to a full-screen, no-scroll, mobile-first design."

**Validation:**
*   The plan successfully addressed the goal by refactoring `OnboardingPage.tsx` and creating the specified modular component structure.
*   An initial logo animation sequence (fade-in/out) was preserved and refined.
*   A 3-slide carousel was implemented using the new `OnboardingSlide.tsx` component.
*   Navigation was successfully updated to rely on swipe gestures (Framer Motion) and clickable dot indicators.
*   'Log In' and 'Sign Up' CTAs are present on the slides, handled by `SlideNavigation.tsx`, and correctly link to placeholder authentication routes.
*   Previous 'Next', 'Skip', and 'Back' button functionalities were removed.
*   The tech stack (React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion) was utilized as planned.
*   Annotations and `registry_map.txt` were updated for all affected artifacts.

**Scope Items Validation:**
*   **Refactor `OnboardingPage.tsx` & Logo Animation:** DONE (Task `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_001`).
*   **Create `OnboardingSlide.tsx`:** DONE (Task `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_001`).
*   **Create Modular Sub-components (`OnboardingLogo`, `SlideVisual`, `SlideTextContent`, `SlideNavigation`):** DONE (Task `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_001`).
*   **Implement 3 Distinct Slides with Content & Auth CTAs:** DONE (Tasks `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_001`, `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_002`).
*   **Swipe Gesture Integration:** DONE (Task `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_003`).
*   **Clickable Dot Indicators:** DONE (Task `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_003`).
*   **Auth CTAs link to T-11 Placeholders:** DONE (Task `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_003`).
*   **Basic Animations (Logo, Slide Transitions):** DONE (Tasks `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_001`, `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_003`).
*   **Full-screen, Mobile-first Layout:** DONE (Verified throughout tasks, specifically `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_002_check_007`).
*   **Annotation & Registry Updates:** DONE (Task `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_004`).
*   **Removal of Old Nav Buttons:** DONE (Task `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_001_check_007`, `plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_task_003_check_007`).

**Exclusions:**
*   The plan adhered to its exclusions (no actual auth logic, no backend data loading, no complex animations beyond what was scoped, no video/advanced media, no localization, limited accessibility focus, strictly mobile-first).

**Next Steps:**
*   The project is currently in an `IDLE` state.
*   Consider initiating a `VALIDATE` phase for the completed onboarding work, if manual user testing or more formal QA is desired beyond the scope of this plan's execution.
*   Prepare for a new planning cycle (`BLUEPRINT` phase) to address further features from the `cycle0_blueprint_proto_frame.txt` or new requirements.
*   Add this validation report (`plan_cycle0_onboarding_g181_validation_report_g186.md`) to `registry_map.txt`.
