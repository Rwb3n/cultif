## 3. Integrated Summary & Key Insights

### 3.1 Core Project Vision & Goals

- **Project Vision:** To launch a monetizable, mobile-first recipe platform ('Cultif' / 'WorldChef') that enables culinary creators to publish content and users to subscribe for premium access. (Charter & PRD)
- **Problem Addressed (PRD):** Consumers struggle to find authentic, nutritionally-transparent recipes and structured meal plans. Professional chefs lack a direct, subscription-based channel to monetize global audiences.
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver a functional MVP within approximately 6 development cycles (around 24 weeks, assuming 20 hours per week of development effort). (Charter & PRD Hypothesis)
- **Value Proposition (PRD):** 
    - Users gain diverse, diet-aware recipes and low-friction meal scheduling.
    - Creators gain recurring income and audience analytics without building infrastructure.
- **Key Objectives & Success Metrics (Charter & PRD):**
    - Achieve a live MVP with functionalities including recipe creation/management (CRUD), basic nutrition information, Stripe-based single-tier monthly subscription, content discovery via search and filters, manual meal planning with a calendar, and basic user engagement features (likes, favorites, push notifications for new recipes).
    - Demonstrate a minimum of $1 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by the end of Cycle 3, primarily through paid pilot users (Charter) /  ≥1 paying subscriber by end of Cycle 3 (PRD).
    - Accumulate at least 100 public recipes and have at least 5 active creators on the platform by the Cycle 5 demonstration (Charter) / by end of Cycle 3 (PRD - needs clarification, likely C5).
    - Subscription conversion ≥3 % of active users by Cycle 4 (Charter & PRD).
    - Recipe page p95 load ≤2 s on median mobile (Charter & PRD).
    - Push opt-in rate ≥40 % (Charter & PRD).
    - Creator churn <15 % per cycle (Charter & PRD).

### 3.2 Key Product Features & Scope (MVP Focus)

- **Core Platform Functionality (Charter & PRD):**
    - Recipe Publishing & Management (CRUD for creators)
    - Nutrition Display (Nutritionally-transparent recipes, initially via stubbed/cached API)
    - Subscription Paywall (Single-tier monthly via Stripe)
    - Content Discovery (Search & Filters)
    - Meal Planning (Manual calendar-based scheduling, grocery list export - implied by calendar)
    - Basic Engagement (Likes, Favorites, Push Notifications for new recipes)
- **Explicitly Out of Scope (Charter & PRD - Consistent):**
    - Multi-currency billing, coupons, automated creator payout disbursement.
    - Real-time features: user-to-user chat, comments on recipes, live streaming.
    - Advanced Machine Learning-driven recommendations or automated/AI-generated meal planning.
    - A web desktop interface (mobile-first only for MVP).
    - Complex video transcoding or interactive video-style recipe playback.
    - Gamified leaderboards or user-submitted completion photos beyond basic engagement metrics.
    - Scheduled posting of recipes by creators.

### 3.3 Technical Stack & Architecture Highlights

- **Core Stack (TRD):**
    - **Client:** React Native 0.74, Expo SDK 51, React Native Paper (Material Design 3). Mobile state managed with Zustand (persisted to SecureStore).
    - **API Gateway:** Fastify 4 (Node 20) presumably behind Cloudflare APIShield as mentioned in TRD.
    - **Database & Backend Services:** PostgreSQL 15 via Supabase.
    - **Authentication:** Supabase JWT (HS256, 24h TTL, 15 min refresh).
    - **Storage:** Supabase S3-compatible bucket (10MB object limit per file).
    - **Payments:** Stripe Checkout (using a specific price ID: `price_worldchef_monthly_001`).
    - **Nutrition Data:** External Edamam v2 API, with a daily sync lambda worker planned.
    - **Push Notifications:** Expo Push API (utilizing FCM for Android).
    - **AI Assistance:** OpenAI models (GPT-3 or similar) via GitHub Actions for tasks like boilerplate code and test generation.
- **Logical Architecture (TRD):**
    - Central Fastify API acts as a gateway, fronting several logical sub-services (Auth, Recipe, Subscription, Search, Notification Worker, Nutrition Worker).
    - All backend services share a single PostgreSQL instance (via Supabase).
    - Inter-service communication is planned via internal function calls rather than a message bus for MVP simplicity.
- **Data Model Principles (TRD):**
    - MVP focuses on embedding custom ingredient nutritional data directly within recipes.
    - Array-based fields for tags like `diet` and `time_of_day` to support multi-select.
    - Dedicated `prep_duration_iso8601` field for preparation times.
    - `subscriptions` table designed for a single-tier, app-wide premium access model.
    - Standard audit fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`), `NOT NULL` constraints, and `ON DELETE CASCADE` rules.
    - Comprehensive indexing strategy including GIN indices for array and full-text search capabilities.
- **Key Non-Functional Requirements (TRD & PRD):**
    - **Performance:** API average latency ≤150ms (p95 ≤300ms). Mobile app initial render <1000ms, JS bundle ≤1.2MB. (TRD)
    - **Scalability:** Target 10,000 MAU on Supabase free/small tier with a clear path for vertical scaling. (PRD/TRD)
    - **Security:** Adherence to OWASP Top 10, GDPR, SCA (via Stripe). Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) extensively used. Secure webhook handling and JWT validation. (PRD/TRD)
    - **Availability:** 99% uptime target. (PRD)
    - **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA for UI elements. (PRD)
    - **Internationalization (i18n):** Basic scaffolding with `i18n-js` library, default to en-US. No Right-to-Left (RTL) support planned for initial cycles. (TRD)
- **CI/CD & Testing (TRD):**
    - GitHub Actions for linting, unit tests (Jest, RNTL, aiming for 80% statement coverage), type-checking, build, and deployment to Supabase Functions & Expo EAS.
    - API contract testing with Pact.
    - E2E testing with Detox (iOS & Android nightly).
    - Load testing with k6.

### 3.4 Development Methodology & Cycle Structure

- **Methodology:** Shape Up, adapted for AI-assisted development. (Shape Up Strategy)
- **Team Composition & Capacity (Shape Up Strategy):**
    - 1 Designer: ~8 hours/week (Figma library, UI/UX design, click-through prototypes, visual feedback).
    - 1 Developer (acting as AI Supervisor): ~12 hours/week (Supervising AI agents, prompt engineering, code review & validation, debugging, strategic technical decisions, manual tasks, integrating AI-generated modules).
    - AI Code Agents: Utilized for generating initial code, tests, documentation stubs, and granular plans.
    - Total estimated team capacity: ~20 hours/week.
- **Cycle Structure (Shape Up Strategy):**
    - Duration: 4 weeks per cycle (approximately 80 hours total team capacity).
    - Betting: Maximum of 1-2 core "bets" (major feature areas) per cycle.
    - Scope Management: Appetite is fixed; scope is aggressively cut to fit. Features are simplified or killed, not extended within a cycle. Cool-down between cycles (max 1 week) for bet review.
- **High-Level Cycle Roadmap Overview (Shape Up Strategy - aligned with individual Cycle Blueprints):**
    - **Cycle 0 (Proto Frame):** High-fidelity Figma click-through prototype of core mobile flows and a basic, navigable React Native (Expo) + React Native Paper (Material Design 3) shell application. Key focus on design library and static UI. *No backend code, live data, or full auth logic.*
    - **Cycle 1 (Lean Content Pipeline):** Core content creation (image-based recipes by creators) and public read flow. Includes Supabase schema (users, creators, recipes with RLS policies), Recipe CRUD operations (image-only uploads to Supabase Storage), basic email authentication (signup, login, JWT management), and a stubbed/cached nutrition data worker (e.g., using Edamam API for basic macros, with aggressive caching or Nock stubs). Public, unauthenticated read access for all recipes is key. Mobile screens will cover Auth, Home Feed (latest recipes), Recipe Detail (full view with basic nutrition), and a multi-step Recipe Upload Wizard. *Excludes likes/favorites, video uploads/transcoding, advanced search/filters, tag auto-suggest, and per-creator subscriptions.*
    - **Cycle 2 (Micro-Monetization):** Single-tier monthly subscription via Stripe Hosted Checkout, paywall enforcement for premium recipes (via `is_paid` flag and RLS update on `recipes` table), and ledger table for platform revenue. Stripe Product (`worldchef_premium_monthly`) and Price ID to be configured. API endpoints for creating checkout sessions, checking subscription status, and handling Stripe webhooks (`checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.deleted`). Mobile screens for subscription offer/flow (T-08) and paywall modal (T-04). *Creator revenue is conceptually recorded by tracking platform revenue in the ledger; detailed share calculation/disbursement is post-MVP. Excludes multi-currency, coupons, Stripe Connect, credit models.*
    - **Cycle 3 (Basic Discovery):** Basic full-text search (Postgres `pg_trgm`/`unaccent` on key recipe/creator attributes like title, cuisine, diet, creator display name), structured filtering capabilities (e.g., by diet, cuisine, `is_paid`), and a simplified "Top Creators" leaderboard (e.g., based on recipe count via a Materialized View `creator_trending`, refreshed hourly). API endpoints for search and leaderboard. Mobile UI enhancements for search input (T-02), filter application (T-14 FilterDrawer), search results display (T-10), and a new Leaderboard screen. *Excludes ML recommendations, synonym mapping, advanced search algorithms, infinite scroll (uses pagination).*
    - **Cycle 4 (Meal Plan MVP):** Users can create weekly meal plans using a calendar grid UI (T-07 MealPlan-CalendarView) with slots for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack. Recipes can be added to/removed from these slots. A basic CSV grocery list can be exported, based on aggregated ingredients from the planned meals (aggregation sums quantities for identical name/unit pairs, no complex unit conversions). `meal_plans` table to store plan data (potentially as JSONB). API endpoints for meal plan CRUD and grocery list export. A plan creation wizard (T-15) may guide initial setup. *Excludes automatic macro tracking/calculation, multi-timezone support for week start, recipe portion scaling, PDF grocery list export, and AI-generated meal plans.*
    - **Cycle 5 (Retention Hooks):** "Likes" and "Favorites" for recipes, "follow creator" functionality, basic Expo push notifications (e.g., new recipes from followed creators), and a simplified Creator Dashboard (e.g., total views/likes via Materialized View). *Excludes comments, real-time interactions, advanced analytics, email digests.*
- **Task & Story Generation (Shape Up Strategy):**
    - Detailed user stories and technical tasks are to be generated by an AI agent at the beginning of each cycle.
    - Inputs for AI: Current Cycle Blueprint, PRD, TRD, Figma Catalogue.
    - This AI-generated "granular blueprint" is then reviewed and approved by the human Developer (AI Supervisor).
    - This approach replaces a traditional, pre-defined static backlog for future cycles.
- **Definition of Done (Shape Up Strategy):**
    - **For a feature/module:** AI-generated code reviewed & approved, annotations generated & reviewed, tests (AI-assisted & human-validated) green, merged to the cycle's integration branch, deployed to staging (if applicable), and relevant Figma screens/components confirmed as implemented.
    - **End-of-cycle DoD:** Successful staging deployment of all cycle deliverables and a recorded demo video.

### 3.5 UI/UX Approach

- **Initial UI Framework (TRD & C0 Blueprint):** React Native (Expo) with React Native Paper (Material Design 3). This represents a change from an earlier consideration of Tailwind CSS (noted in C0 Blueprint g_last_modified=8 and TRD manual_review_comment g=7).
- **Design Process & Tooling (C0 Blueprint):**
    - Figma is the primary design tool.
    - Cycle 0 focuses on establishing a Figma Library (Foundations, Atoms, core Molecules) and high-fidelity screens for key templates.
    - A comprehensive Figma click-through prototype is a key deliverable of Cycle 0 for demonstrating primary user navigation paths and gathering early feedback.
    - Informal user testing of the Figma prototype is planned for Cycle 0.
- **Theming (C0 Blueprint):** Dark/Light mode color tokens to be defined in Figma (Foundations) and conceptually stubbed into the React Native Paper Theme configuration during Cycle 0. Actual theme switching logic is deferred post-Cycle 0.
- **Screen Catalogue Insights (`src_uiscreens_g85` Doc):**
    - The `App UI Screen Catalogue.txt` provides a detailed breakdown of numerous screens based on visual mockups/images.
    - It covers key user flows: Onboarding, Authentication (Login/Signup), Home/Discovery, Dish Details & Cooking Steps, Meal Planning, User Profile & Settings, Creator Profile & Dashboard, Recipe Upload, and Subscription/Paywall flows.
    - Common UI patterns include top filter chips/tabs, horizontally scrolling content cards, Floating Action Buttons, bottom navigation bars, and standard Material Design-esque components (cards, buttons, input fields, status bars, icons).
    - The catalogue implies a rich feature set, and screen states (e.g., different steps in onboarding or recipe playback) are clearly delineated.
- **Interactive Presentation Storyboard Insights (`src_presstory_g85` Doc):**
    - This Markdown document acts as a blueprint for an animated, interactive presentation of the app.
    - It defines screen-by-screen sequences for major user flows: App Entry/Onboarding, Login/Sign Up, Home & Main Navigation, Content Creation/Upload, Meal Planning, and Exploration.
    - For each screen, it specifies: referenced Figma images, key visual elements, entry/exit animations (e.g., fades, slides), internal element animations (e.g., logo pulses, button glows), and interactive hotspots with their navigation targets.
    - General animation principles emphasize smooth, quick transitions (200-300ms) and subtle engagement.
- **Figma Page Catalogue Insights (`src_figmacat_g85` Doc):**
    - This CSV file serves as a crucial link between design artifacts and development planning.
    - It catalogues UI templates/patterns using `Template ID` (e.g., T-01a to T-23) and `Frame Name`.
    - Each entry details `Composition / Key Features`, its `MVP Cycle Relevancy` (e.g., Cycle 0, Cycle 1), and provides `Corresponds to Figma Screens (Examples)` to link abstract templates to concrete Figma mockups.
    - Covers a wide array of UI areas including Onboarding, Home/Explore, Recipe Details, Creator Profiles, Upload Wizards, Meal Planning, Subscription, Dashboards, Auth, and more.
    - Essential for identifying reusable UI components and understanding the phased visual implementation according to MVP cycles.

### 3.6 Quality Assurance & Testing Approach (Test Strategy)

- **Core Strategy:** Adherence to a test pyramid model, emphasizing comprehensive unit tests, targeted integration tests, and critical-path E2E tests.
- **Tooling Summary:**
    - Unit Tests: Jest, React Native Testing Library.
    - Integration Tests: Jest, TestContainers (for isolated Postgres), Nock (for HTTP mocking).
    - E2E Tests: Detox.
    - Performance Tests: k6.
    - Security: Dependabot, npm audit, manual RLS reviews.
    - Accessibility: axe-core, manual Figma reviews.
- **Key Coverage Goals:**
    - Unit Test (Server-side business logic): ≥70% statement coverage.
    - E2E Tests: 100% execution of defined critical MVP user paths before staging deployment each cycle.
    - Performance: API p95 latency ≤300ms; Recipe page p95 load ≤2s.
- **AI Role in Testing:** Generating initial test stubs, boilerplate for common scenarios (unit), suggesting integration points, and potentially outlining E2E test scripts.
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions to run linting, type-checking, unit, and integration tests on every PR. E2E tests run against a seeded Staging environment.

## 4. Next Steps & Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive review of all provided source materials, the following next steps are recommended:

1.  **Formally Adopt `source_review_doc_g85`:** This document (`artifacts/reviews/source_review_g85.md`) should be considered the baseline understanding derived from the initial source material. Its `artifact_id` is `source_review_doc_g85`.
2.  **Update `registry_map.txt`:** Ensure all reviewed source documents and this review document itself are registered with their assigned artifact IDs and correct file paths.
    *   `src_charter_g85`: `source/2. Project Charter.txt`
    *   `src_prd_g85`: `source/3. Product Requirements Document.txt`
    *   `src_trd_g85`: `source/4. Technical Requirements Document.txt`
    *   `src_shapeup_g85`: `source/1. Plan_ Shape Up Strategy_.txt`
    *   `src_c0blue_g85`: `source/1.0 Cycle 0 Blueprint — Proto Frame.txt`
    *   `src_c1blue_g85`: `source/1.1 Cycle 1 Blueprint — Lean Content Pipeline.txt`

    *   `source_review_doc_g85`: `artifacts/reviews/source_review_g85.md`
3.  **Proceed with User-Requested Next Actions (Updated based on clarification g110):** Address the user's follow-up request to:
    *   Update `plan_cultif_main_mvp.txt` (pending detailed instructions or if it's to be superseded by a new Cycle 0 plan).
    *   Draft a Cycle 0 plan. This plan will focus on creating a **React.js (web-based)** high-fidelity click-through interactive prototype of core user flows. This involves scaffolding all necessary directories and files, with each file containing detailed comment-based placeholders outlining its specific purpose, planned content (including placeholders for actual UI elements or logic), references to design documents (e.g., Figma Catalogue IDs), and checklists for implementation. The primary goal of this web prototype is to allow stakeholders to review and provide feedback for adjustments before committing to mobile application development. This will likely become a new plan file, e.g., `plan_cycle0_webreact_prototype_gX.txt`.
4.  **Cycle 0 Technology Clarification (Updated based on clarification g110):** The immediate focus for Cycle 0 is the React.js web-based interactive prototype. Following the review and feedback phase for this web prototype, a subsequent phase will address the scaffolding of the **React Native mobile application shell using Material Design 3**, ensuring all components are prepared for backend and logic integration, as originally outlined in documents like the TRD and C0 Blueprint.
