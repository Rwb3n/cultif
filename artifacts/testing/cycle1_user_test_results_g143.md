# Test Results Summary - UI Refinement (plan_cycle1_ui_refinement_g131 / pc1uir_task_008)

**Date of Test:** Current (g=147)
**Tested By:** User (manual browser/console tests), AI (build attempts)

## 1. Build Process (pc1uir_task_008_check_001, pc1uir_task_008_check_001a)

*   **Initial Attempt (g=143):** FAILED.
    *   **Reason:** Missing `prop-types` dependency.
    *   **Issue Logged:** `issue_prop_types_g144` (Severity: HIGH)
    *   **Console Output Snippet:** `Error: The following dependencies are imported but could not be resolved: prop-types (imported by D:/PROJECTS/cultif/prototypes/cycle0_react_web/src/components/primitives/Grid.jsx) ...`
*   **Resolution (g=144):** Installed `prop-types` via `npm install --save-dev prop-types`.
    *   **Status:** `issue_prop_types_g144` marked as RESOLVED.
*   **Subsequent Build Attempts (assumed successful post prop-types install for dev server testing):** User was able to launch and test the application, implying the dev server build was successful after dependency installation.

## 2. User Browser & Console Testing (pc1uir_task_008_check_002 - pc1uir_task_008_check_005)

User launched the application and performed navigation and interaction testing at g=145 and g=146. The following issues were identified from console logs:

### 2.1. React Warning: Unknown `flexDirection` prop (g=145)

*   **Description:** React warning `React does not recognize the flexDirection prop on a DOM element.` observed in `Box.jsx` when used in `Card.jsx` on `HomePage.jsx`.
*   **Issue Logged:** `issue_flexdirection_prop_g145` (Severity: MEDIUM)
*   **Resolution (g=145):** Modified `prototypes/cycle0_react_web/src/components/primitives/Box.jsx` to correctly handle `flexDirection` and other common flexbox props, preventing them from being passed to the underlying DOM element. Annotation block updated.
*   **Status (g=146):** `issue_flexdirection_prop_g145` marked as RESOLVED. User confirmed warning no longer present in subsequent console logs.

### 2.2. Network Error: Placeholder Images Not Resolving (g=145)

*   **Description:** Multiple `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors for image URLs pointing to `via.placeholder.com`. Affected components: `Header.jsx`, `RecipeCard` and `CreatorCard` within `HomePage.jsx`.
*   **Issue Logged:** `issue_placeholder_img_g145` (Severity: LOW)
*   **Resolution (g=146):** Switched from `via.placeholder.com` to local placeholder images provided by the user in `/public/assets/placeholders/`. Updated `Header.jsx` and `HomePage.jsx` to use these local paths. Annotation blocks updated.
*   **Status (g=146):** `issue_placeholder_img_g145` marked as RESOLVED. User confirmed errors no longer present in subsequent console logs.

## 3. Visual/Functional Inspection (pc1uir_task_008_check_005)

*   **`flexDirection` Issue:** The React warning was primarily a console issue, but improper prop handling could potentially lead to subtle styling differences or prevent expected flex behaviors if `flexDirection` was intended for the DOM element directly (which it was not in this case).
*   **Placeholder Images:** The network errors resulted in broken/missing images. Switching to local placeholders resolved this visual defect.
*   **Overall:** With the resolution of the console issues, the primary visual and functional aspects related to these specific errors are now addressed.

## Summary & Next Steps

All identified issues from the build and initial user console testing for `pc1uir_task_008` have been addressed and marked as RESOLVED.

The prototype should now build correctly and render without the previously noted console errors.

Next steps within `pc1uir_task_008`:
*   Final user verification of UI and functionality.
*   Completion of this Test Results Summary Document (this document).
