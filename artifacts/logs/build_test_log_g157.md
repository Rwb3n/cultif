## Summary:

The Vite build completed successfully after the initial migration of `.jsx` files to `.tsx`, configuration of `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, and `vite.config.ts`.

An initial failure occurred due to an empty `vite.config.ts` file (tool application issue), which was subsequently corrected, leading to this successful build.

No critical build-breaking type errors were encountered that prevented the build from completing. Further type annotation and linting can be addressed in subsequent steps or tasks.
