  "description": "User has specified (g:29) that the interactive presentation (originally planned as static HTML/CSS/JS under tasks plan_cycle0_showcase_and_foundations_g20_task_003 and plan_cycle0_showcase_and_foundations_g20_task_005) should now be developed using React. This represents a significant change to the technical approach for artifact animated_screens_src_g22 and will require re-planning or major modification of the existing plan.",
