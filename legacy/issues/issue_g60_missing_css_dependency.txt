  "description": "The CSS file \`foundations.css\` (artifact \`design_library_lite_css_g21\`), which is an output of the completed task \`plan_cycle0_showcase_and_foundations_g20_task_002\` and a critical input for the active task \`plan_cycle0_showcase_and_foundations_g20_task_003\`, cannot be located. Attempts to find it at its \`expected_path\` (\`src/css/foundations.css\`) and an alternative path mentioned in notes (\`src/interactive_presentation/src/foundations.css\`) have failed. This blocks the development of the React-based Vercel presentation.",
