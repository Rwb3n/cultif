  "title": "Onboarding slide animation direction is inversed for specific transitions",
  "description": "The slide animation in OnboardingPage.tsx (artifact OnboardingPage_tsx_g181) shows incorrect directionality when transitioning from slide 1 to 2 (acts like 'previous' instead of 'next') and from slide 3 to 2 (acts like 'next' instead of 'previous'). Transitions originating from slide 2 (2->1 or 2->3) are correct. This suggests the 'slideDirection' variable is effectively misinterpreted by Framer Motion in specific cases. Proposing refactor to use variants and the 'custom' prop.",

  "resolution_summary": "The initial jank described (1->2 and 3->2 inversed) was superseded by more complex directional inconsistencies. Ultimately resolved by a complete reimplementation of the animation logic in OnboardingPage.tsx at g=197 using an index-based approach (see issue_animation_final_fix_g197). The variant-based approach attempted at g=195 did not fully solve the underlying problem.",
