  "title": "Project Type Mismatch with Provided shadcn/ui Setup Guide",
  "description": "The user provided a setup guide for shadcn/ui with Vite and Tailwind CSS v4 that assumes a TypeScript project (requiring edits to tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, and vite.config.ts). However, the current project 'prototypes/cycle0_react_web' appears to be a JavaScript project (using .jsx files, and tsconfig.json is missing). This prevents proceeding with the guide's steps for tsconfig and vite.config.ts modifications. Checklist item pc0ms_task_003_check_002 (shadcn/ui setup) is blocked.",
