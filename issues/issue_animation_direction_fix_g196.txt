  "title": "Slide animation direction inconsistent with swipe direction",
  "description": "The slide animations in OnboardingPage.tsx (artifact OnboardingPage_tsx_g181) aren't consistently aligned with swipe direction. When swiping left from slide 1, slide 1 incorrectly exits to the right while slide 2 enters from the right. When swiping right from slide 3 to slide 2, slide 3 incorrectly exits to the left. When swiping left from slide 2 to slide 3 again, slide 2 incorrectly exits to the right. The previous attempt using variants didn't fix the issue. Need to refactor to focus on physical swipe direction rather than slide index relationship.",

Ultimately resolved by a complete reimplementation of the animation logic in OnboardingPage.tsx at g=197 using an index-based approach (see issue_animation_final_fix_g197).",
