  "title": "Tailwind CSS Initialization Failure due to NPX/NPM Environment Issue",
  "description": "The command 'npx tailwindcss init -p' consistently fails with 'npm error could not determine executable to run'. This occurs even after clearing npm cache, and attempting global and local installations of tailwindcss, postcss, and autoprefixer. Listing 'prototypes/cycle0_react_web/node_modules/.bin' shows that the 'tailwindcss' executable symlink is not being created by npm install. This prevents the execution of checklist item pc0ms_task_003_check_001 of plan plan_cycle0_mobile_styling_g150.",
