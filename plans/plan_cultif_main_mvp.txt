  "goal": "To develop and launch a monetizable, mobile-first recipe platform ('Cultif' / 'WorldChef') enabling creators to publish content and users to subscribe for premium access. The MVP will include core functionalities for recipe creation and management (CRUD), image-based media storage, basic nutrition information, user authentication, a single-tier Stripe-based monthly subscription with paywall enforcement, content discovery via search and filters, manual meal planning with grocery list export, and basic user engagement features like likes, favorites, and push notifications. The project will be executed over approximately six 4-week cycles, adhering to the Shape Up methodology, with a strong emphasis on AI-assisted development and a lean, iterative approach to deliver a functional MVP.",
  "scope": [
    "Development of a React Native (Expo, React Native Paper - Material Design 3) mobile application for iOS and Android.",
    "Implementation of a Fastify (Node.js) backend API.",
    "Utilization of Supabase for PostgreSQL database, authentication, and S3-compatible storage.",
    "Cycle 0: Creation of a Vercel-hosted interactive UI presentation, foundational design elements, and a basic React Native shell.",
    "Cycle 1: Implementation of a lean content pipeline including recipe CRUD, basic email authentication, image uploads, and a stubbed/cached nutrition data worker.",
    "Cycle 2: Introduction of a micro-monetization layer with Stripe Hosted Checkout for a single-tier monthly subscription and paywall enforcement.",
    "Cycle 3: Development of basic discovery features including full-text search for recipes/creators, filters, and a simplified 'Top Creators' leaderboard.",
    "Cycle 4: Implementation of a Meal Plan MVP allowing users to create weekly meal plans and export a basic CSV grocery list.",
    "Cycle 5: Addition of retention hooks such as 'likes' and 'favorites' for recipes, basic Expo push notifications, and a simplified creator analytics dashboard.",
    "Adherence to defined technical requirements including API performance targets, security controls (RLS, JWT), CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, and basic observability.",
    "Implementation of a testing strategy including unit, integration, E2E, and basic performance tests, with AI assistance for test generation.",
    "All development artifacts (source code, configuration files) that are text-based and managed by the AI will include embedded annotation blocks according to the specified schema.",
    "Management of project state, plans, issues, and artifact registry according to the Hybrid_AI_OS vX.2 framework."

    "A web desktop interface (mobile-first only for MVP).",
    "Complex video transcoding or interactive video-style recipe playback.",

    "Scheduled posting of recipes by creators.",
    "Full dark/light mode implementation beyond initial token definition in early cycles.",
    "Advanced search algorithms, synonym mapping, or 'smart' suggestions beyond basic capabilities.",
    "Multi-timezone support for meal planning or complex recipe portion scaling in early MVP.",
