Creating a dynamic UI Visual Library page within the prototype to showcase all components and primitives. 3. Ensuring all component annotations are updated for accurate bi-directional dependency tracking. 4. Beginning the process of populating existing page components with these refined UI components, guided by their embedded checklists and Figma references.",

    "Analysis of existing scaffolded components (from plan_cycle0_webreact_prototype_g112) to identify common, reusable UI patterns suitable for abstraction into new 'primitive' components (e.g., Typography, IconWrapper, FormInputBase, GridItem, FlexContainer).",
    "Scaffolding of new primitive React component files (.jsx) with comprehensive annotation blocks, placeholder comments for structure, props, and intended usage.",
    "Creation of a dedicated 'UI Visual Library' page (e.g., StyleGuidePage.jsx) that imports and renders examples of all defined primitive and common UI components, showcasing their variations.",
    "Updating the main application router (AppRouter.jsx) to include a navigable route to the new UI Visual Library page.",
    "Systematic review and update of annotation blocks in all relevant existing and new UI components (primitives, common, layout) to ensure `internal_dependencies` and `dependents` are accurately listed and bi-directionally consistent.",
